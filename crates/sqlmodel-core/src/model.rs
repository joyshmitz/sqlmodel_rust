//! Model trait for ORM-style struct mapping.
//!
//! The `Model` trait defines the contract for structs that can be
//! mapped to database tables. It is typically derived using the
//! `#[derive(Model)]` macro from `sqlmodel-macros`.

/// Trait for types that can be mapped to database tables.
///
/// This trait provides metadata about the table structure and
/// methods for converting between Rust structs and database rows.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```ignore
/// use sqlmodel::Model;
///
/// #[derive(Model)]
/// #[sqlmodel(table = "heroes")]
/// struct Hero {
///     #[sqlmodel(primary_key)]
///     id: Option<i64>,
///     name: String,
///     secret_name: String,
///     age: Option<i32>,
/// }
/// ```

    /// The name of the database table.
    const TABLE_NAME: &'static str;

    const PRIMARY_KEY: &'static [&'static str];

    /// Set the auto-generated ID after insert.
    fn set_id(&mut self, id: i64);
